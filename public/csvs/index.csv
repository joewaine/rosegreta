<p>It is fundamental to me to inspire creativity community and compassion in the work that I bring into the world. As a yoga teacher I encourage students to strengthen their ability of proprioception (sensing balancing and spacial awareness without using the eyes.

It is a practice of pratyahara the withdrawal of the senses a  journey of introspection and receptivity. In yoga nidra you set a sankalpa. Your sankalpa is a present tense intention an incisive resolve</p>,text
