about
It is fundamental to me to inspire creativity, community and compassion in the work that I bring into the world. As a yoga teacher I encourage students to strengthen their ability of proprioception (sensing, balancing and spacial awareness without using the eyes. Training your attention to be attuned with the messages you receive from your body) and further them along in their practice of embodiment. Anatomically I speak to the intention of each posture and give a variety of options to accommodate various body shapes. I regularly teach: Vinyasa: An active fluid practice linking breath to movement. Yin: A yielding, allowing, regenerative practice. Focusing on stressing and compressing the connective tissue, fascia, ligaments, bones and joints. Yoga nidra: A guided meditation. It is a practice of pratyahara, the withdrawal of the senses, a  journey of introspection and receptivity. In yoga nidra you set a sankalpa.  Your sankalpa is a present tense intention, an incisive resolve, thought with determination and conviction. As a KEXP DJ I want to help facilitate music discovery and foster connection through shared experience. I tend to favor shoegaze, hip hop, dream pop, soul, rock, atmospheric, environmental, synth-pop, new wave or honestly anything genuine and authentic and totally immersing! I have a pretty open mind and am always willing to give something a chance. Check out my archived shows https://www.kexp.org/djs/greta-rose/
