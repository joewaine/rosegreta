"I started as a volunteer at KEXP in 2014 and after volunteering in numerous capacities (DJ assistant, in-studio hospitality and business support intern) I was hired on as board-op for remote broadcasts and live in-studio performances. In August of 2018 I became a DJ at KEXP! It is an honor and a privilege to connect with people via radio, the live stream and the mobile app on a weekly basis. Music is a fantastic form of creative expression&#44; an emotional interconnecting force for humans and a powerful medium to convey social change. KEXP provides a platform to keep artists thriving and to thread people together through community. This is an invaluable service and I am stoked to have my show every Monday 2am-6am PT. Tune in next week! Or stream the archives anytime! I love interacting in real time with listeners from all around the world.",text
