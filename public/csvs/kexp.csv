Kexp I started as a volunteer at KEXP in 2014 and in August of 2018 I became a DJ at KEXP.  Music is a fantastic form of creative expression"," an emotional interconnecting force for humans and a powerful medium to convey social change. KEXP provides a platform to keep artists thriving and to thread people together through community. This is an invaluable service and I am stoked to have my show every Monday 2am-6am PT. Tune in next week! Or stream the archives anytime! I love interacting in real time with listeners from all around the world. https://www.kexp.org/djs/greta-rose/,kexp1.jpg
