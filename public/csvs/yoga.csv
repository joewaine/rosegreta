Yoga: This is a resource where you can find: - live vinyasa yoga classes via zoom- already recorded yoga class on youtube- guided meditations (yoga nidra- approximately 25 minutes)- where you can practice in Seattle (temporarily on hold because of covid-19)- opportunity to schedule a private class (temporarily on hold because of covid-19)- corporate yoga - yoga playlists! (more ambient in nature and less lyric-oriented). Yoga credentials: I have been practicing yoga since 2011 and have been teaching since August of 2017 when I did my initial 200 hour teacher training. I assisted as a coach for this vinyasa training in summer of 2018, fall of 2018 and fall of 2019. I also studied yoga nidra, yin and pranayama in a 100hr YTT and assisted as a coach for the following yoga nidra, yin and pranayama training in winter of 2020. I value the lineage of yoga going back to India and structure every class I teach to incorporate yoga philosophy and traditions to honor its origin.,yoga1.jpg
