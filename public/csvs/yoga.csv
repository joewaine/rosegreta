"I have been practicing yoga since 2011 and have been teaching since August of 2017 when I did my initial 200 hour teacher training. I assisted as a coach for this vinyasa training in summer of 2018&#44; fall of 2018 and fall of 2019. I also studied yoga nidra&#44; yin and pranayama in a 100hr YTT and assisted as a coach for the following yoga nidra&#44; yin and pranayama training in winter of 2020.",text
I value the lineage of yoga going back to India and structure every class I teach to incorporate yoga philosophy and traditions to honor its origin.<br><br>,text
